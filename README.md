# Image_Generation_using_Stable_Diffusion

# Part 1: Stable Diffusion
  - Installing the libraries (xformers library to memory optimization)
  - Pipeline for image generation (Creating the prompt -> Generating the image -> Saving the result)
  - Generating multiple images
  - Parameters (Seed, Inference steps, Guidance scale (CFG), Image size (dimensions), Negative prompt)
  - Other models (SD v1.5, SD v2.x, Fine-tuned models with specific styles)
  - Changing the scheduler(PNDM (default), DDIM Scheduler, K-LMS Scheduler, Euler Ancestral Discrete Scheduler (Euler A), DPM Scheduler)
# Part 2: Prompt Engineering
# Part 3: Fine-tuning
# Part 4: Image-to-image
# Part 5: Inpainting
# Part 6: ControlNet
